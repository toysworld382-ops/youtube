# InfinityFree Alternative Hosting Guide with Ad Integration

## ⚠️ Important Notice About InfinityFree

**InfinityFree does NOT support Python/Flask applications.** InfinityFree only supports:

## 💰 Ad Integration Guide

### Google AdSense Integration

**Step 1: AdSense Account Setup**
1. Apply for Google AdSense at [adsense.google.com](https://adsense.google.com)
2. Add your domain to AdSense
3. Wait for approval (can take 1-14 days)
4. Generate ad codes for different placements

**Step 2: Ad Code Implementation**
I've created an ad-integrated version of your website (`index_with_ads.html`) with the following ad placements:

**Ad Placement Strategy:**
- **Header Banner**: Top of page for maximum visibility
- **Sidebar Ad**: Desktop-only sidebar placement
- **Content Ad**: Between main content and features
- **Bottom Banner**: Footer area for additional revenue

**Ad Code Template:**
```html
<!-- Replace ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX with your AdSense publisher ID -->
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

<!-- Ad Unit -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
     data-ad-slot="XXXXXXXXXX"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>
```

**Step 3: ads.txt File**
Create an `ads.txt` file in your Flask app:

```python
# Add this route to your main.py
@app.route('/ads.txt')
def ads_txt():
    return Response(
        "google.com, pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX, DIRECT, f08c47fec0942fa0",
        mimetype='text/plain'
    )
```

### Alternative Ad Networks

**1. Media.net (Yahoo! Bing Network)**
- Good alternative to AdSense
- Contextual ads
- Competitive rates

**2. PropellerAds**
- Pop-under and display ads
- Instant approval
- Good for international traffic

**3. AdThrive/Mediavine**
- Premium ad networks
- Higher revenue potential
- Requires significant traffic (25k+ monthly views)

**4. Carbon Ads**
- Developer-focused advertising
- Clean, non-intrusive ads
- Good for tech audiences
